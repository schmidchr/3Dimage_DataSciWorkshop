# 3Dimage_DataSciWorkshop

## Objectives:
- hands-on experience with Jupyter notebooks executed on [Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) and its integration with github

- data science and machine learning by exploring published solutions to [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com) at the example of ['Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation) as presented in a local [meetup (Nov-2 2018)](https://www.meetup.com/CH-Kaggle-Competitions/events/255809413/?read=1&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDRhZDI0ZDc3LTAxMzctNGY0MC1iMmFlLTNkNmYxZjBiZjJhYQ&_af=event&_af_eid=255809413)

## remaining issues to solve:
- access and writing to Google drive from Google colab (authorization code not stable?)
- PoC to sync Jupyter notebook via github  and execute locally (venv, or list of dependencies)
